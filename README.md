#### What is Computeralgebra?

Computeralgebra is the scientific area which concerns itself with non-numerical mathematical algorithms and their implementations.
Therefore it is the means which materializes mathematical theory into applicable algorithms and programs. 
Cryptography is just one of other many topics which is handled by Computeralgebra researchers.

#### Computeralgebra Professionals Group Germany

([Fachgruppe Computeralgebra](https://fachgruppe-computeralgebra.de/fachgruppe/))
The Computeralgebra Professionals Group Germany is a group of the GI ([Gesellschaft für Informatik](https://gi.de/)). 
Furthermore it is associated to the DMV ([Deutsche Mathematikervereinigung](https://www.mathematik.de/)).

#### CAR Article

The CAR version of the analysis contains an explanatory introduction to the IT-Security and standardization context for the mathematical audience:
